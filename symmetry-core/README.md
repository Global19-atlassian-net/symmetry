symmetry-core
--
This module contains code in development for the symmetry analysis of biomolecular structures.

Development Fields and Research Lines:
- **CE-Symm Mirror**: detect and analyze mirror symmetries.
- **ChainSorter**: sorting chains to their overall symmetry order (application for sequential algorithms).
- **SSE Detection**: detect the number of SSE of the symmetric repeats of a protein.
- **Refiners**: new types of symmetry refiners for CE-Symm, like the MultipleRefiner, which runs the 
algorithm multiple times to create a complete alignment graph.
- **Order Detectors**: new types of order detectors for CE-Symm to determine the number of symmetric repeats 
of a structure.
