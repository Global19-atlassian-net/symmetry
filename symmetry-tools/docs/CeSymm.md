CE-Symm
=======

Usage
-----

The easiest way to run CE-Symm is via the included wrapper script.

```
usage:  runCESymm.sh [OPTIONS] [structures...]
```

CE-Symm can also run directly through java without using the wrapper script.
On many systems, double clicking the JAR file should open the program in
interactive mode. From the command line, it can be run as

```bash
java -Xmx500M -jar cesymm-*.jar [OPTIONS] [structures...]
```

Options
-------

Options are specified in gnu style. Boolean options can be negated by prefixing with "no".
All common options have short forms.

Interactive mode
----------------

By default, running CE-Symm will enter interactive mode. It will prompt you
for an input structure and display the result in a jMol window.

```bash
runCESymm.sh
```

You can also pass one or more structures to the program to bypass the input
dialog. A number of common ways to specify protein structures are supported,
including PDB IDs, SCOP domain identifiers, PDP domains, and filenames. See
BioJava's [StructureID.getStructure()](
http://www.biojava.org/docs/api/org/biojava3/structure/StructureIO.html#getStructure%28java.lang.String%29)
method for the complete syntax.

```bash
runCESymm.sh 1HIV
runCESymm.sh 1GEN.A d1tl2a_ PDP:1RI6Aa
```

Batch mode
----------

To run CE-Symm on many structures, specify input and output files. The input
should contain a list of whitespace separated structure identifiers. Lines
beginning with '#' are ignored. Note that using <tt>--input</tt> disables jMol
display by default. Use <tt>--jmol</tt> to override this behavior.

```bash
runCESymm.sh --input=queries.txt --xml=output.xml
```
An important feature in the batch mode is the multithreading implementation.
By *default*, all the allowed CPUs are used to run the symmetry analyses in 
parallel. The option `-threads N` can be used to set the number N of threads
to use. Note that the scaling efficiency of the multithreading is not perfect,
and the **thread overhead** becomes significant with more than 8 threads.

Output
------

CE-Symm can output results in a number of formats. Format options may be followed
by a filename (`--stats=out.txt`). If the filename is empty or '-', output will
be sent to the terminal. To prevent structure names from being interpreted as
filenames, it is recommended to use the hyphen explicitly (e.g. `--stats=-`,
although `--stats` may work alone in some contexts).

If no format is specified, CE-Symm will default to printing the simple format to
standard out, although this can be surpressed with the `-q` option.

The following formats are supported. Most formats represent the symmetry as an
alignment from the structure to itself.

* __Simple__: Intended to be a simple human-readable summary of results. Lists
  one line per query, giving the symmetry determination and information about
  how that conclusion was reached.
* __Stats__: Provides more detailed statistics about each result. See below
  for a description of the fields.
* __TSV__: A list of aligned residues for each structure,  with a line containing 
  only '//' to separate records.
* __FATCAT__: A single file containing all alignments in FATCAT's traditional output
  format, with a line containing only '//' to separate records.
* __XML__: All the alignments in a custom XML format suitable for machine parsing.


***Statistics Output***

The `--stats` option outputs a tab-delimited file with the following columns:

- __Name__ Name of the structure
- __NumRepeats__ Total number of repeats detected by CE-Symm, including multiple
  levels of symmetry if detected.
- __SymmGroup__ Symmetry Group of the top level of symmetry. This includes
  point group symmetry (Cn or Dn), helical symmetry (H), and translational
  repeats (R).
- __Refined__ 'true' or 'false', indicating whether refinement was successful
- __SymmLevels__ Number of symmetry levels detected
- __SymmType__ OPEN or CLOSED symmetry
- __RotationAngle__ Angle of rotation at the principal axis (degrees). Closed
  symmetry may deviate from ideal values due to the superposition procedure.
- __ScrewTranslation__ Translation parallel the principal axis (Ã…)
- __UnrefinedTMscore__ TM-Score of the self-alignment prior to refinement
- __UnrefinedRMSD__ RMSD of the self-alignment prior to refinement
- __SymmTMscore__ Average pairwise TM-Score of all repeats in the alignment
  after refinement
- __SymmRMSD__ Average RMSD of all repeats in the alignment after refinement
- __RepeatLength__ Number of aligned residues in each repeat
- __CoreLength__ Number of _ungapped_ columns in the alignment
- __Length__ Total length of the protein
- __Coverage__ Fraction of the protein aligned
